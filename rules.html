    <section class="rules-section" id="rules">
        <h2 class="section-title">Full Rules</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="rules-content">
                <h3>1. General Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.1 Respect all members of the community. Offensive, discriminatory, or aggressive behavior will
                        not be tolerated. Treat everyone with kindness, empathy, and understanding.</li>
                    <li>1.2 All members must adhere to the general rules and guidelines of Discord as well as the
                        specific rules of this server. We expect mutual respect and active participation in fostering a
                        positive atmosphere.</li>
                    <li>1.3 Every member is responsible for their actions on the server. Using accounts that do not
                        belong to you is prohibited. Always be aware of the responsibility for what you post, say, and
                        share.</li>
                    <li>1.4 Do not post content that could endanger the safety of others. This includes phishing
                        attempts, malware, links to harmful websites, and any other attempts to steal personal data.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Communication on the Server</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2.1 Use the appropriate channels for discussions. Each channel on the server has a specific
                        purpose. By respecting this purpose, conversations will remain organized, effective, and
                        relevant.</li>
                    <li>2.2 Avoid spamming messages, emojis, links, or any content that disrupts the flow of
                        conversation. Spamming, in any form, is prohibited and may result in warnings or penalties.</li>
                    <li>2.3 Posting NSFW (Not Safe for Work) content, hate speech, discriminatory, racist, or sexist
                        materials, or anything that violates Discord's Terms of Service is strictly prohibited.</li>
                    <li>2.4 Be helpful and welcoming, especially towards new members. Remember that the first impression
                        you make can influence the atmosphere of the entire community.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Permissions and Roles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3.1 Respect the roles and permissions of others. Every user has a specific role on the server,
                        and permissions are granted accordingly. Do not interfere with other users' roles unless you
                        have the appropriate permissions.</li>
                    <li>3.2 Do not attempt to gain access to administrative channels or perform administrative actions
                        without authorization. Such actions will be taken very seriously.</li>
                    <li>3.3 Members have the right to report inappropriate behavior to moderators or administrators.
                        Abuse of power or harassment by staff members will not be tolerated.</li>
                    <li>3.4 Every member has the right to file complaints about inappropriate behavior and ask for
                        moderator or administrator intervention, without fear of retaliation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Advertising and Spam</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>4.1 Advertising other servers, YouTube channels, Twitch accounts, or similar platforms is
                        prohibited unless previously authorized by the administrators.</li>
                    <li>4.2 Unsolicited promotional content or spam messages are not allowed. Keep the server clean and
                        enjoyable for everyone.</li>
                    <li>4.3 Links to external websites that may be suspicious or dangerous should be immediately
                        removed. Always be cautious when sharing links.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Events and Tournaments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>5.1 Participation in events, contests, and tournaments organized by the community is voluntary.
                        However, participants must follow the specific rules set by the event organizers.</li>
                    <li>5.2 Event registration should be done through the appropriate channels. Participants must
                        respect event schedules and organizers' guidelines to ensure smooth proceedings.</li>
                    <li>5.3 Event organizers have the right to introduce additional rules for their events. All
                        participants must accept these rules before taking part in any event.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Sanctions and Penalties</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>6.1 Violating the rules may result in warnings, temporary kicks, or permanent bans, depending on
                        the severity of the violation. Each case will be evaluated individually by the administrators.
                    </li>
                    <li>6.2 Before imposing a penalty, the user will have the opportunity to explain their behavior.
                        Administrators will make fair decisions, considering the nature of the violation and the
                        context.</li>
                    <li>6.3 In cases of repeated violations, a permanent ban from the server may be imposed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7. Rule Changes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>7.1 The rules may be subject to change as the community evolves. Any changes will be announced
                        in the announcements channel, and members are expected to review the updated rules regularly.
                    </li>
                    <li>7.2 Members should periodically review the rules to stay informed about any updates. It is each
                        user's responsibility to stay up to date with the rules.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8. Acceptance of the Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>8.1 By joining the server, you automatically accept these rules and agree to follow them during
                        your time here.</li>
                    <li>8.2 If you have any questions or doubts about the rules, feel free to contact the administrators
                        for clarification.</li>
                </ul>
