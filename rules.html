                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Welcome to the Better Side of Gaming server! To maintain a positive atmosphere and ensure fair and
                    safe gameplay for all users, please familiarize yourself with the following rules. Adherence to
                    these rules is mandatory for all members of the community. Violating any of the points outlined
                    below may result in appropriate sanctions.</p>

                <h3>1. General Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1.1 Respect for All Members:</strong> Every individual is expected to interact with
                        others respectfully and courteously. This includes refraining from any form of offensive,
                        discriminatory, aggressive, or harassing behavior. We value diversity within our community and
                        encourage open discussions. Disagreements are natural, but they must be handled civilly. Members
                        are expected to refrain from any action that could make another member feel unsafe or unwelcome,
                        including but not limited to hate speech, personal attacks, or bullying.</li>
                    <li><strong>1.2 Adherence to Discord’s Terms of Service:</strong> This server operates under the
                        rules and guidelines of Discord. By being a part of this community, you are automatically
                        agreeing to follow Discord’s official Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. Any violation
                        of Discord’s rules, such as spamming, harassment, or unauthorized commercial activities, will
                        lead to immediate consequences including a potential ban from the server. Ensure that you are
                        familiar with these guidelines at all times to maintain a healthy environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>1.3 Accountability for Your Actions:</strong> Each member is fully responsible for their
                        own account and actions within the server. You must not share your account details with anyone,
                        and under no circumstances should you use someone else’s account to access the server. If your
                        account is compromised, it is your responsibility to notify an administrator immediately.
                        Additionally, members are held accountable for any posts or messages sent through their
                        accounts, even if they were sent unintentionally or in error.</li>
                    <li><strong>1.4 Protecting the Community:</strong> It is forbidden to post links, files, or any
                        content that can harm the security of the server or its users. This includes but is not limited
                        to phishing attempts, malware, spyware, harmful links, or any form of content aimed at
                        exploiting vulnerabilities in Discord or the community. If you suspect a user is attempting to
                        spread harmful content, report it immediately to the administrators. The safety of the community
                        and individual users is paramount, and violations of this rule will be treated with the utmost
                        seriousness.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Communication on the Server</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2.1 Correct Channel Usage:</strong> Each channel on the server serves a specific
                        purpose, and it is crucial that members use the appropriate channels for their messages. This
                        helps in maintaining order and ensures that conversations remain relevant to the topic at hand.
                        For example, do not post game-related content in the introduction channel, or spam off-topic
                        messages in channels meant for specific discussions. Always read channel descriptions to
                        understand their intended purpose.</li>
                    <li><strong>2.2 Spamming is Not Allowed:</strong> Spamming, whether it’s messages, emojis, links,
                        images, or repeated content that disrupts the conversation, is not allowed. This includes
                        excessive use of emojis, flooding the chat with repeated messages, or continuously posting
                        irrelevant content. Spamming can create frustration among other members and makes it difficult
                        to keep discussions organized. Any form of spam will result in penalties such as a warning or a
                        temporary ban.</li>
                    <li><strong>2.3 NSFW, Hate Speech, and Inappropriate Content:</strong> Posting content that is
                        sexually explicit, discriminatory, or hateful in nature will not be tolerated. This includes any
                        form of racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, or any other kind of harmful or offensive
                        speech. NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content, such as explicit sexual content, graphic violence, or
                        disturbing imagery, is strictly prohibited. Violators will be immediately banned from the
                        server, and their accounts may be reported to Discord for further action.</li>
                    <li><strong>2.4 Using Proper Language:</strong> Vulgar language, insults, or offensive content
                        directed at another user or group is strictly prohibited. Members are encouraged to express
                        their opinions respectfully and thoughtfully, even in the event of disagreements. Keep
                        discussions friendly, constructive, and appropriate for all members. Offensive language or
                        behavior that creates a hostile or unwelcoming environment will result in warnings, suspensions,
                        or a ban from the server.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Permissions and Roles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3.1 Respecting Roles and Permissions:</strong> The server uses a role-based permission
                        system to manage users’ access to different areas and features. Each role has specific
                        permissions associated with it, and these roles should be respected. Do not attempt to take on
                        responsibilities or privileges that are not assigned to you, especially those associated with
                        administrative tasks. Unauthorized actions such as changing roles or trying to access private
                        channels are strictly prohibited and will result in penalties.</li>
                    <li><strong>3.2 Administrative Channels:</strong> Administrative channels are restricted to
                        authorized staff members only. These channels are intended for moderation, management, and
                        server configurations. Any attempt to gain unauthorized access to these channels, or to disrupt
                        the activities within them, is considered a serious violation and will result in immediate
                        action, including a potential permanent ban from the server.</li>
                    <li><strong>3.3 Reporting Misbehavior:</strong> Every user has the right to report any inappropriate
                        behavior they encounter, including spamming, bullying, cheating, or violations of any rule. If
                        you experience or witness inappropriate actions, please use the designated reporting system. All
                        reports will be taken seriously, and administrators will investigate each incident thoroughly.
                        Refrain from personally confronting the individual involved—let the moderators handle the
                        situation to ensure fair treatment.</li>
                    <li><strong>3.4 Protection Against Abuse:</strong> No member, including moderators or
                        administrators, is allowed to abuse their powers. Any staff member who is found to be misusing
                        their authority will face disciplinary action. If you feel you are being mistreated by a staff
                        member, you have the right to report the behavior to higher-level administrators without fear of
                        retaliation. We aim to maintain fairness and transparency in our actions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Advertising and Spam</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>4.1 Unauthorized Advertising:</strong> Advertising other Discord servers, YouTube
                        channels, Twitch streams, websites, products, or services without prior approval from the
                        administration is not allowed. This includes unsolicited direct messages promoting these things.
                        Such actions disrupt the purpose of the server and make it difficult for members to engage in
                        meaningful discussions. Any instance of unauthorized advertising will result in an immediate
                        warning or ban, depending on the severity.</li>
                    <li><strong>4.2 Promotional Messages:</strong> Any promotional content, such as promotional codes,
                        discounts, or affiliate links, that has not been approved by the administrators is also
                        prohibited. The server is not a platform for personal or business promotion unless it is a part
                        of an approved event or initiative. Unauthorized promotional posts will be removed, and the
                        member will face penalties.</li>
                    <li><strong>4.3 Suspicious or Harmful Links:</strong> Do not share links that could potentially harm
                        the server or its members, such as phishing links or malware. Always verify the safety of a link
                        before sharing it. Harmful links will be removed immediately, and users who share them will face
                        penalties, which may include a ban.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Events and Tournaments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>5.1 Participation in Events:</strong> Our server occasionally hosts events, contests,
                        and tournaments. Participation in these events is voluntary, but all participants must adhere to
                        the specific rules outlined by the event organizers. Failure to follow the event rules may
                        result in disqualification from the event and/or further penalties.</li>
                    <li><strong>5.2 Registration for Events:</strong> All sign-ups for events should be done through the
                        appropriate channels designated for that event. You must follow the format and guidelines
                        provided by the event organizers to ensure your participation. Improper sign-ups, failure to
                        adhere to deadlines, or failure to follow event guidelines may result in your removal from the
                        event.</li>
                    <li><strong>5.3 Special Event Rules:</strong> Some events may have additional specific rules,
                        depending on their nature. These rules will be communicated clearly in the event details. By
                        signing up for an event, you agree to abide by these additional rules, and failure to do so may
                        result in disqualification from the event or penalties, including a temporary or permanent ban
                        from the server.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Sanctions and Penalties</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>6.1 Types of Sanctions:</strong> Violations of the server rules may result in a variety
                        of sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation. These sanctions include, but are not
                        limited to, warnings, temporary kicks, temporary or permanent bans from the server, or the
                        removal of specific privileges, such as access to certain channels. The administrators will
                        determine the appropriate sanction based on the nature of the offense.</li>
                    <li><strong>6.2 Appeals Process:</strong> If you believe that a sanction has been unfairly applied,
                        you have the right to appeal the decision. Appeals should be submitted to the administrators
                        through the designated appeal channel, where you must provide a detailed explanation of the
                        situation. Administrators will review each appeal on a case-by-case basis and may choose to lift
                        or adjust the sanction if the appeal is deemed valid.</li>
                    <li><strong>6.3 Repeated Violations:</strong> If a member repeatedly violates the server rules, more
                        severe penalties will be imposed. Repeated offenses will lead to escalating sanctions,
                        potentially culminating in a permanent ban. It is important to adhere to the rules consistently
                        to maintain your place in the community.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7. Rule Changes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>7.1 Updating the Rules:</strong> The server rules may be updated periodically to ensure
                        they reflect the evolving needs and dynamics of the community. Any changes will be announced in
                        the announcements channel, and members are expected to read and familiarize themselves with the
                        updated rules. It is the responsibility of each member to stay informed about the current rules.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>7.2 Acknowledging Changes:</strong> Once a rule update is announced, continued
                        participation in the server implies acceptance of the new rules. If you disagree with the
                        changes, you may choose to leave the server, as failure to adhere to the updated rules may
                        result in loss of access.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8. Acceptance of the Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>8.1 Automatic Acceptance:</strong> By joining the server and participating in its
                        activities, you automatically agree to abide by these rules. Ignorance of the rules is not an
                        excuse for violating them. It is your responsibility to read, understand, and follow them.</li>
                    <li><strong>8.2 Contacting Administration:</strong> If you have any questions, concerns, or need
                        clarification about the rules, please contact the administrators via the designated support or
                        help channels. Our team is available to assist and ensure you have a positive experience on the
                        server.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>9. Reporting Violations of the Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>9.1 Reporting Violations:</strong> Any violation of the rules should be reported to the
                        administrators or moderators of the server. Reports are taken seriously and will be reviewed as
                        quickly as possible. To make a report, please use the designated report channels, providing as
                        much detail as possible to help us resolve the issue efficiently. This includes the user
                        involved, the nature of the violation, and any supporting evidence like screenshots or messages.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>9.2 Confidentiality of Reports:</strong> All reports made will be handled with
                        confidentiality. We encourage members to report violations without fear of retaliation. The
                        administration will take the necessary steps to address the situation fairly and impartially.
                    </li>
                </ul>
